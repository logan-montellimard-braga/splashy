# Splashy Octopus
Test of Phaser.js game framework with a trivial flappy bird-like. With an octopus. And bonus objects. Woaw.


Also, a school project.


### How to play ?
Clone or download the repo, and put it behind a web server, whichever you like. Phaser.js needs a webserver to load some contents by Ajax.
If you access the site locally, you won't have any sounds available but AFAIK the rest should be fine.
